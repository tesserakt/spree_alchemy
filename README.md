# Spree-Alchemy Integration

Use this connector if you want to have Spree handle the frontend of your app, but also want to pepper in bits and pieces of CMS content.

### Features:

1. Relies on Spree Authentication, giving you a unified user system. Spree Admins can access Alchemy
2. You can inject dynamic content into product and taxon pages (i.e. a "story" section on a t-shirt page)
3. You can create whole pages like /about-us and have alchemy control that content

## Spree

This version runs with Spreecommerce 2.3.

## Alchemy

This version runs with Alchemy 3.0

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem 'alchemy_cms', git: 'git@github.com:magiclabs/alchemy_cms.git'
gem 'spree_alchemy', git: 'git@github.com:tesserakt/spree_alchemy.git'
```

And then execute:

```shell
$ bundle
```

Install the migrations:

```shell
$ rake spree_alchemy:install:migrations
```

Migrate the database:

```shell
$ rake db:migrate
```

## Installation parts needed to be done manually
In your application_controller.rb, put the following code:
```ruby
  def current_user
    spree_current_user
  end
```


In your main app's routes.rb file you will need to mount Spree at the root '/'. We also like to mount Alchemy at /cms.
If you have Alchemy generate any whole pages, you will want your main app to route any unknown routes to Alchemy. For example,
if you want an About Us page, you want to capture mysite.com/about-us and have alchemy take care of this.   This "catch all" route will
need to be the last route in your routes.rb file

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
mount Spree::Core::Engine, at: '/'
mount Alchemy::Engine, at: '/cms'

# These routes get mounted last in your app!
get '/:lang' => 'alchemy/pages#show',
   :constraints => {:lang => /[a-z]{2}(-[a-z]{2})?/},
   :as => :show_language_root

# The page show action has to be last route
get '(/:lang)/*urlname(.:format)' => 'alchemy/pages#show',
    :constraints => {:lang => /[a-z]{2}(-[a-z]{2})?/},
    :as => :show_page
```

## Usage

To inject dynamic content into a page, you will create a page that has a Product Essence and associate that page with the product you want.
Once you have done this, you can add a decorator to the Spree Products controller that will load the page associated with the current product.

In your products controller show action decorator:

```ruby
essence =  Alchemy::EssenceSpreeProduct.where(spree_product_id: @product.id).first
@page = essence.pages.first
```

And in your view override or defacement:

```ruby
<%= render_elements %>
```

### Create a new Element for Alchemy

```yaml
# config/alchemy/elements.yml
- name: product
  contents:
  - name: spree_product
    type: EssenceSpreeProduct

- name: product_category
  contents:
  - name: spree_taxon
    type: EssenceSpreeTaxon
```

### Ensure that a layout contains the product element type!
in config/alchemy/page_layouts.yml

```yaml
- name: product_content_page
  cells: [slider]
  elements: [video_slide, image_slide, content_block, call_to_action, product]
  autogenerate: [video_slide, content_block, content_block, content_block, call_to_action]
```

### Generate the views

```shell
$ rails g alchemy:elements --skip
```

### TODO

1. Search for page in Alchemy Admin by products associated
2. A product can be associated with many different layout types, so only allow one product per layout type per page.

## Attribution

This plugin was inspired from the alchemy-spree gem developed at Magic Labs. In fact it is a rewrite of that gem.
Their focus is to have Alchemy rule the site and inject products into it. We prefer the other way around.
